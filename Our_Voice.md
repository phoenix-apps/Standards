# Our voice

## What do we mean by "Our voice?"
The Phoenix voice is how we talk to people. It’s the combination of attitude, style and succinctness.

It's important that we're always polite, and that we adapt our tone depending on the situation. We must be serious, empathetic, and even light-hearted depending on the situation and context.

# Main Principles

Our voice hinges on crisp simplicity. Bigger ideas and fewer words. Less head, more heart. Shorter (but still clear and human) is always better.

Our voice is:

* Warm and relaxed. We’re natural. Less formal, more grounded in real, everyday conversations. Occasionally, we’re fun. (We know when to celebrate.)

* Crisp and clear. We’re to the point. We write for scanning first, reading second. We make it simple above all.

* Ready to lend a hand. We show one another and our customers that we’re on their side. We anticipate their real needs and offer great information at just the right time.

# A focus on the context

Talking to one another and our customers in a way that’s warm and relaxed, crisp and clear, and ready to lend a hand reflects our commitment to empowering people to achieve more.

* Get to the point fast. Start with the key takeaway. Put the most important thing in the most noticeable spot. Make choices and next steps obvious. Give people just enough information to make decisions confidently. Don’t get in the way.

* Talk like a person. Choose optimistic, conversational language. Use short everyday words and sentence-style capitalization. Avoid jargon and acronyms.

* Simpler is better. Everyone likes clarity and getting to the point. Break it up. Step it out. Short sentences and fragments are easier to scan and read. Prune every excess word.

* Highlight key information with bold text or headings. If someone was to scan what you'd written to find out the smallest possible information (such as what to do first), what would you want them to read?

# Write like you speak

Read your text aloud. Does it sound like something a real person would say? Be friendly and conversational. No. Robot. Words. 

For example  
Replace this: **Invalid ID**  
With this: **You need an ID that looks like this: someone@example.com**

# Revise weak writing

Most of the time, start each statement with a verb. Edit out you can and there is, there are, there were. 

For example  
Replace this: **You can access Phoenix apps across your devices, and you get live updates and information.**  
With this: **Access Phoenix apps online, access them from all your devices, and share the latest information with coworkers.**
