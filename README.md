We're a limited company who want to make repetitive tasks take less time.

## FAQ

### Who is Phoenix Apps?

We're a company focused on helping small to medium teams of people, who don't have much time to learn or to invest in learning big new complex processes, and instead want to focus on getting running quickly. We want to empower you to do more, to be more inventive, and to be free to focus on the things that you want to, without unnecessary friction

### Why Open Source?

Empowering teams doesn't just mean creating tools and products that everyone can use. Sometimes, it means creating something for the specific experts within a team. These tools, that might only be used by one or two people in a team, can be hard for you to justify commercially, even though you love them! As a result, we want them to be free and available for you

### How can I help with open source?

We need and value your feedback and expertise on our open source projects. They're useful to you and save you time, so you're the expert. We want to invite you to be part of the process as we create and mould these apps together, to empower one another
